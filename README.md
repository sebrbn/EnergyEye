# EnergyEye
A real-time home automation system that monitors electricity consumption using an LDR and ESP32, transmitting data via MQTT to a web app for live tracking and appliance control.

This project is a unique home automation system that tracks real-time electricity consumption using an LDR to detect meter blinks. The ESP32 transmits this data via MQTT to a web app, allowing users to monitor energy usage and control appliances remotely using relays.

Key Features:
Real-time Energy Monitoring via LDR detection.
Web-Based Dashboard for live tracking and appliance control.
MQTT Communication for efficient data transfer.
Scalability to support more devices and features.
Setup:
Hardware: ESP32, LDR, relay module.
Software: MQTT broker, web app, ESP32 firmware.
Installation: Connect components, install dependencies, flash ESP32, deploy the web app.
Future Enhancements:
Mobile app, AI-based energy optimization, voice control, and battery backup.
